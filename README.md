## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
